## Introduction
Welcome to BARK Prediction dApp! This decentralized application (dApp) built on the Solana blockchain empowers users to participate in prediction markets and unleash predictive insights on Solana.

## Features:
- **Prediction Markets:** Participate in prediction markets on various assets.
- **Real-time Price Feeds:** Access up-to-date asset prices including SOL, BARK, BTC, ETH, and more.
- **Token Swapping:** Seamlessly swap tokens across different clusters. Swap tokens using Jupiter Terminal V2 - Works only mainnet and need custom RPC or Jupiter API.
- **Account Management:** View balance, transaction history, and more.
- **Donation Functionality:** Contribute to charitable causes directly from the dApp.
- **Integration with BARK Token:** Stake BARK tokens, vote on governance proposals, and access premium features.
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Interact with the dApp using assets from different blockchain networks.
- **Decentralized Governance:** Participate in decision-making processes related to platform upgrades and feature enhancements.
- **Privacy Features:** Prioritize user privacy and confidentiality through privacy-enhancing technologies.

## ToDO: Jupiter Terminal V2

To integrate token swapping using Jupiter Terminal V2, which works only on the mainnet and requires a custom RPC or Jupiter API.

1. **Integration with Jupiter Terminal V2 API**: Incorporate the Jupiter Terminal V2 API into your application to enable token swapping functionality. You'll need to make API requests to perform token swaps, so ensure you have the necessary endpoints and authentication tokens.

2. **Custom RPC or Jupiter API Configuration**: Set up a custom RPC endpoint or use the Jupiter API to interact with the Jupiter Terminal V2. This involves configuring part of application to communicate with the appropriate network and endpoints required for token swapping.

3. **User Interface for Token Swapping**: Design and implement a user interface within your application to facilitate token swapping. This interface should allow users to select the BARK and other tokens they want to swap, specify the amount, and initiate the swap transaction.

4. **Transaction Handling**: Implement logic to handle token swap transactions securely within your application. This includes validating user inputs, executing API requests to initiate swaps, and handling transaction responses (success or failure) from the Jupiter Terminal V2.

5. **Error Handling and Feedback**: Implement error handling and feedback mechanisms to users during the token swapping process. Inform users of transaction status updates, errors, or any other relevant information to ensure a smooth user experience.

6. **Testing and Optimization**: Test the token swapping functionality thoroughly to identify and address any bugs or issues. Optimize the performance of your application to ensure seamless token swapping experiences for users.

7. **Documentation and Support**: Document the token swapping feature within prediction dApp, including usage instructions and any prerequisites. Provide support resources or assistance channels for users who may encounter difficulties during the token swapping process.
